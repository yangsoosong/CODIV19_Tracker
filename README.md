# COVID19_Tracker
Build a COVID19 tracker application with Java, Spring Boot (Thymeleaf) and Bootstrap.
Possibly go for React for the front end dev.

## Planned features for the app:
1. dropdown box where user can search desired region
2. set the displayed number of website according to geolocation of the user, if the user doesn't allow location to be turned on, default number is based on Boston, MA.
3. different colors depending on the numbers of the new cases, instead of using plain numbers.
